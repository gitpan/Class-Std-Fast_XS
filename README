INSTALLING ON WINDOWS
=====================

Class-Std-Fast_XS has successfully been compiled on windows using either
MinGW/MSYS/gcc or Visual Studio 2005

Only the MinGW/MSYS/gcc variant is described here - to compile with Visual
Studio, you'll need to a add .manifest XML files for the resulting dll.

Installing on Windows using MinGW/MSYS/gcc
------------------------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------

Install MinGW and MSYS. You may follow the instructions from
http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml
It's probably easiest to just use the installer package for MinGW and MSYS.
You need at least MinGW, gcc, w32api and MSYS.

Install Class-Std-Fast >= 0.0.7

You may install it through CPAN or via ppm (if available).

Preparations
------------

1. Start MSYS. You should see a bash-like shell.
Note that C: is /c/ in MSYS.

2. Setup environment:

You'll have to setup a few environment variables for the header and library
files to be found.

Add the current directory to gcc's include path. This is where the AutoXS
header file for Class-Std-Fast lives.

   @> export CPATH="$CPATH:."

Setup library path for linking. This is where my perl-related dlls live:

   @> export LIBRARY_PATH='/c/perl/bin'

Building and Installing
-----------------------

1. Unwrap into a directory
2. go there
   @>cd /d/workspace/Class-Std-Fast_XS

3. Run the following mantra:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install
