=head1 NAME

Class::Std::Fast_XS - speed up Class::Std::Fast by adding some XS code

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 require Class::Std::Fast_XS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Speeds up Class::Std::Fast by replacing it's accessors/mutators by XS
variants.

The speed gain varies by platform:

Using perl 5.8.8 on Ubuntu 8.04 (32bit) Linux, the measured speed gain
is around 7.5% for accessors (getters) and around 35% for mutators
(setters).

On a RHEL 5.0 box (64bit) with perl-5.8.8 the speed gain is around
40% for getters and around 60% for setters.

The speed gain on ActivePerl 5.8.8 (822) on Windows XP built with
MinGW/MSYS/gcc is around 45%

ActivePerl 5.10 (1001) on Windows XP yielded around 30% for accessors
and 50% for mutators.

=head1 USAGE

All you have to do is to require this module before you load/create
Class::Std::Fast- based classes. More precisely, all Class::Std::Fast-based
attributes (:ATTR) after loading Class::Std::Fast_XS will be affected.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Only attributes detected after loading are affected.
